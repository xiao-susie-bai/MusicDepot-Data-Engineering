# Music Depot Data Engineering 
## -- Data Pipelining with ETL, Data Modeling and DataOps for a music streaming service

Hey there! Welcome to my latest project in the exciting domain of Data Engineering.

With the rise and fast evolution of AI in today's changing world, consistent high-quality and useful data remains a most fundamental ingredient to solve complex problems for stakeholders and to drive business value, yet it is sometimes one of the shortest supplies as well. 
Therefore, through this project for a music online streaming startup, I would love to show the great potential of Data Engineering tools and modern practices, and to share its constant value in the analytics and data science landscapes today.

In this project, I build a data pipeline with data quality checks and orchestration, moving data through different zones following a Medallion data lake architecture and throughout the data engineering lifecycle -- including data ingestion, storage, transformation, and finally serving to downstream marketing analytics stakeholders. AWS services (S3, AWS Glue (including AWS Glue Data Quality), Amazon Redshift with Spectrum, CloudFormation), Terraform, Airflow, dbt, as well as SQL and Python, are some of the tools used in this project.

Let's go!
