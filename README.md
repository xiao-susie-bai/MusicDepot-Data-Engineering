# MusicDepot Data Engineering (Data Pipelining with ETL, Data Modeling and DataOps for a music streaming service)

Hey there! Welcome to my latest project in the interesting Data Engineering domain.

With the rise of AI, high-quality, useful and meaningful data becomes an increasingly important ingredient to solve problems effectively and to create value, yet sometimes one of the shortest supplies. 
Therefore, through this project for a music streaming startup, I would love to show the power of Data Engineering modern practices, and to share excitement from its potential in a changing data world today.

In this project, I build a data pipeline with quality checks and orchestration, following a Medallion structure moving data through different zones during the process of ingestion, storage, transformation, and serving. AWS (S3, AWS Glue, Amazon Redshift with Spectrum, CloudFormation), Terraform, Airflow, dbt, as well as SQL and Python, are tools used in this project.
